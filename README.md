# EAC_project - Genomic Epidemiology side project
This project aims to:

- Conduct genomic epidemiology analyses on publicly available genomes of all Global Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) Surveillance System (GLASS) pathogens isolated in any of the East African Community (EAC) partner States;
- Conduct a systematic literature review to identify the patterns of AMR in EAC countries, and describe the specific resistance profiles of pathogens included in GLASS pathogens;
- Identify any differences in AMR profiles between the different EAC member States.



### GLASS Pathogens
